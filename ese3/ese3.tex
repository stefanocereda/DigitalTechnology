\begin{frame}{JSON}
    You have seen at lesson that JSON is built with name: value pairs.
    A JSON file can thus be described with a Python dictionary.

    The JSON module allows to convert a between python objects and their textual JSON representation.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{JSON --- dumps}
    The \emph{dumps} function converts python variables to strings:
    \begin{minted}{Python}
import json
my_dict = {'firstName': 'John',
           'age': 25
          }
print(type(my_dict))

js_repr = json.dumps(my_dict)
print(js_repr)
print(type(js_repr))
    \end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{JSON --- loads}
    The \emph{loads} function is used to convert from string to python objects:
    \begin{minted}{Python}
# continues from previous slide
my_obj = json.loads(js_repr)
print(my_obj)
print(type(my_obj))
    \end{minted}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{JSON --- dump and load}
    Usually we want to read and write JSON \emph{files} instead of dealing with strings.

    The \emph{dump} and \emph{load} allow to work with files (no trailing \emph{s} as they do not work with
    \emph{s}trings.

    To use them, we first need to be able to open files in Python:
    \begin{minted}[fontsize=\tiny]{Python}
import json
my_dict = {'firstName': 'John', 'age': 25 }

# Open a file in write mode
with open('./my_file.json', 'w') as outfile:
    # outfile is a variable pointing to my_file.json, opened in write mode
    json.dump(my_dict, outfile)
# outfile is closed when we exit the with statement

# now we open the file in read mode and read its content:
with open('./my_file.json', 'r') as infile:
    loaded_obj = json.load(infile)

if loaded_obj != my_dict:
    print("JSON does not work!")
    \end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The open function}
    The \emph{open} function opens a file and return the corresponding file object.
    Its two most important parameters are the \emph{filename}, representing the path to the file to be opened, and the
    \emph{mode}: a string representing how we should open the file ('w' for write, 'r' for read).

    \url{https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{The with statement}
    When we finish processing the file we should close it:
    \begin{minted}{Python}
outfile = open('./my_file.json', 'w')
json.dump(my_dict, outfile)
outfile.close()
    \end{minted}
    However, doing this we must remember to close the file, even if the write instruction fails.

    The with statement is a much more convenient way to deal with file objects, as we have seen in previous examples.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]{Installing external modules with pip}
    We have seen how to import a module from the Python standard library:
    \begin{minted}{Python}
import math
from random import uniform
from json import dumps
    \end{minted}

    However, there exists many modules which are not included in the standard library (numpy, pandas, scipy,
    scikit-learn, etc\ldots)

    You can install, upgrade, and remove packages using a program called \emph{pip}:
    \begin{minted}{text}
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip uninstall numpy
pip freeze
    \end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Virtual environments}
    Different python applications will require different versions of the packages.

    The solution is to create a virtual environment, a directory that contains a
    Python installation plus a number of additional packages.

    Virtualenv creation:
    \begin{minted}{bash}
python -m venv my_venv
# equivalent: virtualenv my_venv
    \end{minted}

    And activation:
    \begin{minted}{text}
my_venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
source my_venv/bin/activate   # Linux and MacOS
    \end{minted}

    Using \emph{pip} with an active virtual environment will work on the virtual environment.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PyCharm, pipenv and anaconda}
    In PyCharm every project has its own virtual environment, and you can easily manage its packages
    (File/Settings/Project/Project Interpreter).

    Other widely used programs for managing virtual environments are pipenv and anaconda.
\end{frame}
